I hold a PhD from the University of California, Irvine, where I developed probabilistic machine learning methods for modeling complex systems across a wide range of scientific and engineering domains. During my graduate studies, I was supported with the Balsells fellowship. You can find my publications [here](https://cmorasar.github.io/publications-talks/). 

Prior to my PhD, I graduated with honors in aerospace engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. 

I am highly motivated to create real-world impact through machine learning solutions that integrate knowledge from diverse disciplines and data modalities.
